     <h2>What works for me</h2>
    
    <div class="text">
        <p>Bullet Journal is not the only method that I use to write down my most important events and to-do lists. This planner helps me to control many aspects of my life.
        </p>
        <P>One example is a sleep tracker. Through using this I am able to pay more attention to how many hours I sleep, which can affect the amount of energy I have during the day. It also motivates me to go to sleep earlier, I think that this is a perfect solution for people with similar problems.
        </P>
        <p>My personal favourite aspect of this system is the ability to adjust all of the pages to your own needs and desires. For example, if you feel that something is not working for, you can just not use it or even replace it with something more appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>Another spread that I use is the table of expenses. Many of you probably believe that these days it is impractical because of technology that allows you to monitor your spending through your smartphone. However, in my case I found that writing it by hand really made me realise how much money I really spend.
        </p>
        <p>The spread which I would personally recommend to everyone is a habit tracker. This is extremely helpful for people who forget about completing their daily duties. The pictures show examples from my BuJo.
